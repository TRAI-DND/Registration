My First Android Project

<B>So,what this android application does is :<B>

1.Collects User data such as - Name,Age,Gender,Email Address,Phone number .

2.Sends the user an SMS confirmation that he/she has been successfully registered and notifies about the activity performed by it via a toast message
(Also ,if the phone number field is left blank or contains illegal arguments , the SMS wont be sent and this error is again notified to the user via a toast message.

P.S :This application uses the "Send_SMS" permission
